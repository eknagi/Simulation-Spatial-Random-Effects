# Simulating-Spatial-Dependency-Random-Effects

Goal: Simulate spatial hierarchical data. Incorporate random effects and spatial dependencies onto a NxN grid; and
assess and compare the fit and parameter estimation of different multilevel models, spatial
models, and models that are a hybrid between the two.
